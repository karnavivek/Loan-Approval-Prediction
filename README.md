# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Kaggle-
This is ML code for Loan Approval Prediction, for Kaggle Competition. 
Achieved a score of 0.95591

This is a Binary Classification Problem, where we have 12 Features to predict if a person will get his Loan Approved or not!
Among those 12 Features, there are 8 Numerical Features & 4 Categorical Features

4 Categorical Features are fed into our model by one hot encoding process.

Details of Dataset:
Size of Training Dataset - (58645, 13)
Size of Test Dataset - (39098, 12)
target feature (y) - 'loan_status' (Binary Classification - 1:Approved 0:Not Approved)

Models used:
1) Logistic Regression
2) Random Forest
3) Gradient Boosting

Among the above model, we chose "Gradient Boosting" model before of its high Accuracy of 0.953875010657345

We also calculated ROC-AUC Curve scores as demanded by the Kaggle Competition submission rules!
